#Responsive Webpage
#Specification
A mobile-first responsive webpage without any library. Pure HTML/CSS with a few lines of JavaScript for the hamburger menu.
#Installation
To install, CLI not required. Simply download to your computer and run "news.html" file in the browser.
#Approach
In building this webpage, the following assumptions were made and addressed:
1.	You are interested in seeing plain HTML/CSS code: This was a challenge at first because I had hitherto relied on bootstrap for most of my applications' responsiveness. So I had to "re-learn". This stretched the development time but it's well worth it, with the eventual outcome. The goal of pure CSS design was achieved after carrying out series of emulation on devices ranging from phone, tablet, phablet, and desktop.
2.	More columns could be added for larger screens: From the specs - not published for privacy reason - given, a two-column table will not look great on a wider screen. This requires doing either of these: [1] Creating two extra columns for wider screens, or [2] Adding a new content entirely. At the end, I settled for the former.

#Potential Improvements
Opacity CSS rule wasn't coming out exactly the way it was illustrated in the specs (It works perfectly when I apply it to body element). The navigation text also wasn't aligning to the icons. I couldn't figure these out due to time. These were the two major improvements identified inline with the specs
